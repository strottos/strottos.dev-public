# Contact Me

If you want to contact me there are a few methods available and I'll do my best
to answer when I can:
- You can contact me through email at my email address:
  [stevetrot@gmail.com](mailto:stevetrot@gmail.com)
- You can contact me on
  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-steven-trotter-11b2294/).

If you want to raise something that you think is incorrect or you want a feature
to be added to this website then please feel free to visit the public version of
this site at
[https://github.com/strottos/strottos.dev-public](https://github.com/strottos/strottos.dev-public)
and raise an issue in GitHub.

It hopefully goes without saying that I have a full time job and may not always
have time to respond immediately or even possibly at all, though I will do my
best to respond when I can.
