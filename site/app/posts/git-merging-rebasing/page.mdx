Some new stuff.

In this article we're going to discuss merging and rebasing in using the
Git version control system. Merging and rebasing are two branching
strategies in git that are attack similar problems in different ways,
they're often a source of confusion for people (particularly rebasing)
who aren't familiar with them and often cause heated debates as to which
one is best.

In this article we'll discuss what each strategy is, why you might use
one over the other, how to decide what's best for you and your team and
how to do each of them like a pro from the command line.

# Git Basics

First some housekeeping to make sure we're all on the same page. This
article is definitely not an introduction to Git, however we go over the
very basics of Git, what branching is,

NB: Many people these days argue that trunk based development is the way
forward for being successful in git these days. As the author of this
piece, my personal take is that though this can work very well for some,
it is not always the best for every team. In any case, if you're doing
trunk based development you have no need for the contents of this
article, both because it's not useful to you, and you're doing something
quite advanced already that probably means you know a lot of the
contents of this article anyway. We're going to assume that you are
interested in branching as a strategy and move on from this.

# Git Merging

First off we address Git merging.
