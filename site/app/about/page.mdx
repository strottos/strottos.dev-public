# About Me

Hi reader, thanks for taking the time to read this about me post in my blog. I'm
Steve, I'm currently employed as a Platform Engineer and Capability Lead but in
my time I've worked as a software engineer, in support departments, I was an
architect for a brief period and I studied for various degrees including a PhD
in pure mathematics. I've worked in a variety of industries and projects too
including large ecommerce platforms, video gaming, networking appliances,
aerospace engineering, gambling, important public sector projects, insurance and
investment banking.

I'm writing this blog for a few reasons:
1. I think I have learned a lot over my years as a Software Engineer, Platform
   Engineer and other disciplines and I like sharing knowledge.
2. I've spent a lot of time helping train engineers in the last few years, and
   I'd like to be able to stop repeating myself and point people to blog posts
   and maybe even videos in time.
3. Teaching is the best way to know if you understand something.
4. It's a showcase of my talents an ability.
5. It was a chance for me to build my skills as a frontend developer.

My interests are pretty varied too, so you can probably expect articles on:
- How to successfully build software in IT.
- All things DevOps/Cloud/Platform Engineering/IaC/CI/CD/etc.
- Rust has been a love affair of mine for the past few years, I even managed to
get a small PR merged for the Rust compiler at one point.
- Scripting, all things Python/NodeJS/Bash/PowerShell/etc.
- Other languages like GoLang, C, Java, C#, etc.
- All things operating systems, Linux, Mac and yes, even Windows.
- Open Source Software.
- Virtualisation.
- Productivity in Software Engineering, so Vim, Terminals, etc..
- Mathematics and Science.

Amongst various other things that take my interest at the time.

In my spare time you'll likely find me spending time with my family, friends or
playing with my cats. I've been happily married since December 2016 and we live
in Worcestershire with a couple of adorable Ragdolls that I can't resist sharing
a recent photo of. I also play (roughly in order of competency) guitar, piano
and drums and like playing various styles, including (not quite so in order of
competency) Classical, Jazz, Rock and Blues.

Here's a link to my latest [CV](pdf/steven_trotter_cv.pdf) for those who want to
know more about my background.
